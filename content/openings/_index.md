TIFR is a leading research institute with a focus on fundamental research, and provides various opportunities for collaborative projects. My group is interested in developing robust first-principles based quantum chemistry methods with a focus on understanding charge-accommodation and charge-transport problems. If you would like to be a part of the quantum chemistry team at TIFR, please consider the following options 

**Postdoctoral researcher:** 
We currently have an opening for a postdoctoral researcher. The project involves developing and/or applying quantum chemistry methods for understanding electron-structure of liquids. If you are interested, please send me an email containing a one-page write-up describing your research background and interests. 

**Graduate student:**
TIFR has a robust graduate program and provides a unique environment for budding researchers. The selection to the program is via an annual entrance examination held in the month of December. For more details, please refer to the [graduate program page.](http://www.tifr.res.in/~dcs/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=106)

**Junior/Senior research fellow:**
We have one opening for a junior/senior research fellow. The student will have an opportunity to learn about and develop electronic and vibrational structure theories of extended systems. If interested please send me an email containing (i) 200 word description of your research interests and (ii) 200 word description of your research background.
