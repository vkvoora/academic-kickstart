With looming materials challenges and development of materials with unforseen properties it is imperative to understand the physical and chemical mechanism underlying such materials. This can, inturn, lead to valuable new design principles. However, the current theoretical tools suffer from lack of universal accuracy: methods often tend to describe one property well but fail at the other. Towards this end we will develop theoretical tools that can help describe multiple chemical properties and enable new design principles. 
The method development will be based on response-theory type formalism that has been successful in predicting multiple properties of molecules and materials at a reasonable accuracy.
