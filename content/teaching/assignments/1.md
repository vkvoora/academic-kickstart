### Assignment 1
1.1 For the ground-state of H$\_2^+$, the simple MO wavefunction is
$\sigma\_g1s(1) = \phi\_{1sa}(1) + \phi\_{1sb} (1)$, where $a$ and $b$ denote the two H atoms, and $\phi\_{1sa} = \frac{e^{-r\_a}}{\sqrt{\pi}}$ is the hydrogen AO. Using confocal elliptical coordinates, show that the overlap integral is given by $S_{ab} = e^{-R}(1+R+\frac{R^2}{3})$. Here, $R$ is the internuclear separation. The volume element in confocal elliptic coordinates is $dv = \frac{1}{8}R^3(\xi^2 -\eta^2)d\xi d\eta d\phi$. The following integral formula can be handy: 
$$ \int\_t^{\infty}z^ne^{-az}dz = \frac{n!}{a^{n+1}}e^{-at}
\bigg( 1+ at + \frac{a^2t^2}{2!} + ... + \frac{a^nt^n}{n!} \bigg), 
n = 0,1,2,... > 0$$. (10 pts)

1.2 For the simple MO and VB wavefunctions of H$\_2$, i.e. obtained from using just the 1$s$  AOs of individual hydrogen atoms (separated by internuclear distance $R$), (i) derive the corresponding ground-state one-particle densities $\rho\_{MO}(\mathbf x)$ and $\rho\_{VB}(\mathbf x)$ for the singlet state. $\mathbf x = (\mathbf r, s)$ denotes the space-spin coordinates. (ii) Show that $\rho\_{MO}(\mathbf x)$ is greater than $\rho\_{VB}(\mathbf x)$ at the mid-point joining the two nuclei. (8 pts)


1.4 Considering the various topics discussed in the class so far, list different ways to improve the simple VB wavefunction for H$\_2$. (4 pts)

1.5 (i) List the different antisymmetrized 2-electron Hilbert space functions for H$\_2$ obtained using the one-electron MO basis of H$\_2^+$, $\sigma\_g1s$ and $\sigma\_u^\*1s$. (ii) For the lowest excited-state of H$\_2$, which has the configuration ($\sigma\_g1s$)$^1$ ($\sigma\_u^\*1s$)$^1$, i.e. one-electron in each of the two one-electron MO functions, comment on the nature of the dissociation limit.
