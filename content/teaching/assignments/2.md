### Assignment 2
2.1 Consider a system (for example, a molecule) consisting of two electrons of different spins that equally populate two different orbitals (whose spatial wavefunctions are given by $\psi\_1$ and $\psi_2$). 
a) Construct the two possible Slate determinants and obtain their expectation value of the energy. 
b) Check that these Slater determinants are not suitable approximate wave functions of such a system [Hint: are they pure spin states?]
c) Which wavefunctions would be suitable approximate wavefunctions? [Hint: try to diagonalize the $S^2$ matrix]
d) What is the energy expectation value of such functions, and which one of them will be more stable? (10 pts)

2.2 For the minimal basis H$\_2$, i.e. a the many-body basis consisting of the two singlet wavefunctions (
$\vert \Phi_0 \rangle = \vert 1 \bar{1} \vert$
, $\vert \Phi\_{1 \bar 1}^{2 \bar 2} \rangle = \vert 2 \bar 2\vert$, where $\vert . \vert$ denotes a Slater determinant, 
$\vert 1 \rangle = \vert  \sigma\_g1s \alpha \rangle$, 
$\vert \bar 1 \rangle = \vert  \sigma\_g1s \beta \rangle$,
$\vert 2 \rangle = \vert  \sigma\_u1s \alpha \rangle$, and
$\vert \bar 2 \rangle = \vert  \sigma\_u1s \beta \rangle$ ), 
show that the full CI Hamiltonian matrix  
$$\mathbf{H} = \begin{pmatrix} 
\langle 1 \vert h \vert  1 \rangle + \langle \bar 1 \vert h \vert  \bar 1 \rangle
+ \langle 1\bar 1 \vert \vert  1\bar 1 \rangle  
&
 \langle 1 \bar 1 \vert \vert 2 \bar 2 \rangle \newline
\langle 2 \bar 2 \vert \vert 1 \bar 1 \rangle &
\langle 2 \vert h \vert  2 \rangle + \langle \bar 2 \vert h \vert  \bar 2 \rangle
+ \langle 2\bar 2 \vert \vert  2\bar 2 \rangle  \newline
\end{pmatrix}$$
and show that it is Hermitian. Show this result without (and with) using Slater-Condon rules. By integrating out spin, show that 
$$\mathbf{H} = \begin{pmatrix} 
2 h\_{11} + J\_{11} & J\_{12} \newline
J\_{21}  &  2 h\_{22} + J\_{22} \newline
\end{pmatrix} \;\text{. (15pts)}$$. 

2.3 Show that the Hartree products
$$
\Psi\_a(\mathbf r\_1, \mathbf r\_2) = \psi\_1(\mathbf r\_1)\alpha(s\_1) \psi\_2(\mathbf r_2)\beta(s_2) $$
$$ \Psi\_b(\mathbf r\_1, \mathbf r\_2) = \psi\_1(\mathbf r\_1)\alpha(s\_1) \psi\_2(\mathbf r_2)\alpha(s_2) $$
a) are uncorrelated and b) have the same energy as that of the antisymmetrized form of $\Psi\_a$, i.e
$$ \psi\_1(\mathbf r\_1)\alpha(s\_1) \psi\_2(\mathbf r_2)\beta(s_2) -
\psi\_2(\mathbf r\_1)\beta(s\_1) \psi\_1(\mathbf r_2)\alpha(s_2)\;\text{. (5pts)}$$.
