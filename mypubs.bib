It is found that the random phase approximation gives the exact excitation energies and exact interaction energy of this system even when allowing only excitations into the first excited levels of the oscillators. In contrast, to obtain the exact results from configuration interaction or coupled cluster treatments of the model requires inclusion of excitations into all accessible excited configurations."

abstract  ="A new series of Ln3+ and Ln2+ complexes has been synthesized using the tris(aryloxide)arene ligand system{,} ((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)3â{,} recently used to isolate a complex of U2+. The triphenol precursor{,} (Ad{,}MeArOH)3mes{,} reacts with the Ln3+ amides{,} Ln(NR2)3 (R = SiMe3){,} to form a series of [((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)Ln] complexes{,} 1-Ln. Crystallographic characterization was achieved for Ln = Nd{,} Gd{,} Dy{,} and Er. The complexes 1-Ln can be reduced with potassium graphite in the presence of 2.2.2-cryptand (crypt) to form highly absorbing solutions with properties consistent with Ln2+ complexes{,} [K(crypt)][((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)Ln]{,} 2-Ln. The synthesis of the Nd2+ complex [K(crypt)][((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)Nd]{,} 2-Nd{,} was unambiguously confirmed by X-ray crystallography. In the case of the other lanthanides{,} crystals were found to contain mixtures of 2-Ln co-crystallized with either a Ln3+ hydride complex{,} [K(crypt)][((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)LnH]{,} 3-Ln{,} for Ln = Gd{,} Dy{,} and Er{,} or a hydroxide complex{,} [K(crypt)][((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)Ln(OH)]{,} 4-Ln{,} for Ln = Dy. A Dy2+ complex with 18-crown-6 as the potassium chelator{,} [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2][((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)Dy]{,} 5-Dy{,} was isolated as a co-crystallized mixture with the Dy3+ hydride complex{,} [K(18-crown-6)(THF)2][((Ad{,}MeArO)3mes)DyH]{,} 6-Dy. Structural comparisons of 1-Ln and 2-Ln are presented with respect to their uranium analogs and correlated with density functional theory calculations on their electronic structures."}
